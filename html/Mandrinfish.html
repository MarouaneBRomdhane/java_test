        The Mandarinfish is one of the most beautiful and stunning fish in the ocean.<br> It is native to the Pacific ocean, ranging from the Ryukyu <br>Islands south to Australia.<br>
        It is a small and shy tropical fish, which is popular as a photographic subject <br>due to its striking beauty and interesting habits.<br>
        Mandarinfish is not a strong contender in finding food, as it is a fussy, careful <br>and slow eater. Its food mainly consists of <br>protozoans, small worms, small crustaceans such as mysids, amphipodsand isopods.<br>
        One of its prominent features is its big outward-set eyes, which is an ideal adaptation <br>for food hunting and feeding in the dim light<br> underwater environment of the ocean.<br><br>
