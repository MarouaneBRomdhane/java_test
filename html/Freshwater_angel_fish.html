        The freshwater angelfish is probably the most recognized fish in the aquarium hobby, which is <br>native to tropical South America, including<br> much of the Amazon River system.
        They are mostly found in the quiet, slow-moving waters in their natural habitat. <br>In the wild, they are seen in dimly lit areas, under vegetation <br>or trees that have fallen into the river.<br>
        The fish belong to Cichlid family, and they come in a variety of beautiful colors <br>and patterns, ranging from colored stripes to<br> solid silver, or black and silver marble. They can live up to <br>10 years or even longer.<br>
        They are generally peaceful, but being cichlids, they can be aggressive while pairing up and spawning. <br>They are opportunistic like most fish and can <br>eat anything that fits into their <br>mouth, including smaller fish around them.<br><br>
