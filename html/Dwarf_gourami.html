        Known as one of the most beautiful aquarium fish, dwarf gourami <br>is native to slow-flowing freshwater rivers, ponds, lakes and rice fields of Southern Asia. <br>However, it can also be found in the USA, Singapore, and Colombia now.<br>
        Formerly known as Colisa lalia, dwarf gouramis continue to rise in popularity. <br>These strikingly colorful fish are low maintenance and prefer to live and stick together when possible. In this way, they feel more secure and comfortable.<br>
        They have an average life span of five years, but under <br>good conditions, they can live even longer. <br>They can grow to a length of up to 4.5 inches, but<br> on average, they only grow up to 3.5 inches in size.<br>
