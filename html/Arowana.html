        Arowanas are freshwater bony fish that are found in the <br>rivers, lakes, and ponds of Asia, South America, and <br>Australia. They are also known as bony tongues.<br>
        These fish have a narrow and thin body shape, which makes <br>them resemble eels. There are about 10 different types of Arowana, 4 from Asia, 3 from South America, 2 from Australia, and 1 from Africa. They are commonly kept as pets.<br>
        Asian Arowana is listed as an endangered species and <br> is banned in the US. It is considered a status symbol, among wealthy Asian men. In 2009, an albino Arowana was sold for a record price of $300,000.<br>
        Mostly pet Arowanas are farmed and raised under high-security <br> fences. They are solitary fish, which <br>only allow company when young, adults <br>may show aggression and dominance towards others.<br><br>
