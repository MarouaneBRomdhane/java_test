        Found in the western Indian Ocean, including the Red sea, and in <br>the Pacific Ocean as far east as Japan and southeast Australia, the<br> sea goldie is a small tropical fish that inhabits the translucent <br>waters of lagoons and coral reefs, up to 20 metres in depth.<br>
        These fish are protogynous hermaphrodites, like the other members of their family. <br>They are born as females but turn into males <br>at some point in their life.<br>
        They are organized in a harem system, in which one male protects and controls several <br>females, and that makes them<br> aggressive and territorial.<br>
        When a school loses its male, females can change their sex and turn into a male. <br>Their coloration changes from orange to pink, when females change their sex and turn into a male. <br> Females are typically two times smaller in size than males.<br><br>
