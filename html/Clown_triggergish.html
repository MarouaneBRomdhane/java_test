        The Clown triggerfish is a brightly colored fish, and it can also be referred to as the foraging predator. <br>They are widely spread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters<br> of the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean.<br>
        They can be found around the reefs in the wild waters, where shellfish and other invertebrates are found. <br>These are very aggressive and territorial fish.<br>
        While being very attractive and colorful, they can be the most aggressive inhabitant of an aquarium. <br>So while selecting their tank mates, choose other large and aggressive fish. <br>As once they reach around the size of 5 to 6 inches, they are <br>pretty much not afraid of anything.<br><br>
